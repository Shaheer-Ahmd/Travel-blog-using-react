# Travel Blog

## Introduction

This project is a simple travel blog developed using React, which demonstrates the use of props rendering and the concept of reusable components. The blog displays a list of destinations along with a brief description of each. Clicking on a destination name takes the user to the blog page for that destination, where they can read more about it.
